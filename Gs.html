<h2>
Some stuff that GEF has done for the world is providing addtional support to devolping countires. GEF has provided $32 million USD to help countries
that are still in the devolping phase. The money GEF has provided will go to the making of 50 courties which is due to the United Nation Framework Convention
On Climate Change, or in other words, UNFCCC. Also, GEF has donated $3 billion USD in support of countries with low devolpement to adapt to the changes in
the climate. Next, GEF has provided a lot of support during COVID. They provide information on COIVD, telling positive things we could do and during 
2020 when COVID just became serious and they were working dangerously hard on ensuring our safety. Lastly, GEF is trying to reduce a toxic chemical call "Mecury".
If a human has exposure to mecury, their immune and digestive systems, kidneys, lungs, skin and eyes could occur negative effects. So GEF is trying to
reduce mecury by giving soulution to the public on what to do when in contact with it and telling people everything they are allowed to say.
