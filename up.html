GEF is a good IGO to fund because unlike other inter-govermental organizations, GEF focuses on improving our world. For example, one of GEF's main goals 
are to help provide support to devolping countries, which is good because those countries would not be able to afford living supplies for their people, 
to get protection from larger IGO's like NATO or if they have to don't have good and expensive resources. Also, GEF is one of the most highest funders for 
environment issues. For example, when global warming becomes a really dangerous problem in the futrue, we are able to reley on GEF to provide solutions, and help 
us chanage the way we live. Lastly, GEF supports and works on projects the try to prevent areas to suffer. For example, areas that were to suffer from droughts,
natural disaters and low environmental stability. So to sum up everything that has been stated so far, GEF is one of the world's best IGOs, and the prime minister
should really start funding for it.
